/* This program is responsible for actually setting up the grain sandbox.
 * Tempest invokes it as:
 *
 * tempest-sandbox-launcher <package-id> <grain-id>
 *
 * It configures a sandbox using the directories for that package & grain, and
 * then inovkes execveat() to start the `tempest-grain-agent` executable, which then
 * takes over starting up and interfacing with the grain proper.
 *
 * The grain will be given access to stdout, stderr. and file descriptor #3 (used
 * as a Cap'n Proto RPC socket). The (external) pid for root of the grain's pid
 * namespace is printed to file descriptor #4, which is then closed; the caller should
 * send SIGKILL to this process to stop the grain, then wait on the sandbox launcher.
 *
 * This program is written in C, rather than Go, because:
 *
 * 1. There have historically been many bugs and gotchas around multi-threaded
 *    programs that drop elevated privileges, and there is no such thing as a
 *    single-threaded Go program.
 * 2. More broadly, this is an area of the code where we aren't really processing
 *    user input, and we are more concerned with polluting the sandbox with ambient
 *    state from the operating system -- so it is better to not have a complex language
 *    runtime underneath us.
